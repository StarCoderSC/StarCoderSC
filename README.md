## 🚀 What I Built

I focus on creating simple, effective tools that make life easier. My projects mostly consist of:

- **CLI applications** (task managers, notepads, file organization)
- **Web apps** (blog platforms, contact management, etc.)
- **Automation tools** (scripting repetative tasks)

Check out some of my featured projects below:
